All permutations of a given String

Write program to return word as a list value and its length as a key in descending sorting order from below sentence, -
Input => 
String statement = "Hello World My name is Jane and I hate Mango Fruit ";
Output=>
{5 = [“Hello”, “World”, “Mango”, “Fruit”], 4 = [“name”, “Jane”, “hate”], 3 = [“and”], 2 = [“My”, “is”], 1 = [“I”]}

Write down longest prefix from list of strings.
Example:
1] Input List = {“Apple”, “App”, ”Aptitude”, ”Apex”}
     Output -> “Ap”
2] Input List = {“Apple”, “App”, ”Pineapple”, ”Apex”}
     Output -> “” (Empty String)
     
Count words in a String

Write a function solution that, given a string S of length N, returns the length of the shortest unique substring of S, that is, the length of the
shortest word which occurs in S exactly once.
Examples:
1. Given S = "abaaba", the function should return 2. The shortest unique substring of S is "aa"
2. Given S = "zyzyzyz", the function should return 5. The shortest unique substring of S is "yzyzy". Note that there are shorter words, like "yzy",
occurrences of which overlap, but they still count as multiple occurrences.


Given A = [7, 1, 2, 8, 2], the function should return 2. The value 1 occurs exactly one time; the value 2 occurs exactly two times.
Given A = [3, 8, 2, 3, 3, 2], the function should return 3. The value 2 occurs exactly two times and the value 3 occurs exactly three times, so they
both meet the task conditions. The value 8 occurs just once, thus it does not meet the task conditions. The maximum of 2 and 3 is 3.

This is Binary Tree, 
Please write a function which will provide maximum sum from root to leave nodes.
     9+8+9	= 26
     9+8+6  = 23
     9+7+6  = 33
     9+7+4  = 20
     

Code for binary search


Standard ranges:
0 - 500
500 - 1000
1000 - 2000
Code to check whether user input range is valid or not.
Input:
Valid:
0 - 500
1000 - 2000
500 - 1000
Valid:
0 - 500
500 - 1000
Invalid (500 - 1000 is missing)
0 - 500
1000 - 2000
